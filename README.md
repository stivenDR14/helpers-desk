## 🏗️ How It Works

### 🎯 Step 1: Define Your Objective

Users set a goal that AI agents need to accomplish collaboratively.

### 🏆 Step 2: Assign Roles & Descriptions

Define up to 5 different AI agent roles, each with specific responsibilities.

### 🤖 Step 3: AI-Driven Execution

The LangGraph orchestrator delegates tasks to AI agents, generating a comprehensive solution.

### 📝 Step 4: Evaluate AI Performance

The system scores AI-generated responses using a predefined quality guide to assess effectiveness.
